# UFO Sightings Exercise

This exercise you will read in a data file line by line and construct a hash with the key for the month and the value the number of sightings for that month.

Some of you might be interested in checking out Rspec early. So I've included a spec file to run against the exercise. You'll also notice a `Gemfile`, you can [read more](http://bundler.io/gemfile.html) about them on your own, but for nowjust know it's the easiest way to get the same set of gems installed across different development environments. You can install the gems with `bundle install` which will read though the `Gemfile` and install the correct versions. After you can run `rspec spec/ufo_sightings_spec.rb` to see if your exercise passes the specs.
